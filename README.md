# CROSS-VALIDATION
CROSS VALIDATION TECHNIQUE 
Cross Validation is a technique which involves reserving a particular sample of a dataset on which you do not train the model. Later, you test your model on this sample before finalizing it.
Here are the steps involved in cross validation:
You reserve a sample data set
Train the model using the remaining part of the dataset
Use the reserve sample of the test (validation) set. This will help you in gauging the effectiveness of your modelâ€™s performance. If your model delivers a positive result on validation data, go ahead with the current model. It rocks!
